`VISUAL DESIGN ISSUES (OBSERVED PATTERNS)
  PEOPLE NOT SEEING WHAT TO DO
  PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY SEE
  PEOPLE EXPECTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY SEE

VISUAL DESIGN TOOLS



CONSISTENCY
* IN ORDER FOR COMMUNICATION TO OCCUR, AN APP MUST HAVE PATTERNS OR CONVENRIONS WITH SHARED OR DISCERNABLE MEANING
* CONSISTENCY IS THE KEY TO THE INTERFACE FUNCTIONING AS A SYSTEM AND A VISUAL LANGUAGE
* ESTABLISHING CONSISNTENCY MEANS SETTING AND MAINTAINING EXPECTIATIONS BY USING ELEMENTS PEOPLE ARE FAMILAR WITH
* ESTABISHING


USER EXPECTATIONS PLAY A ROLE IN PERCEPTION OF CONSISTNENCY
  BASE DECISIONS ON WHAT USERS EXPECTS AS WELL AS APP GOALS

EXTERNAL CONSISNTENCY
  CONSISTENCY : PLACE ELEMENTS SIMILARLY FROM SCREEN TO SCREEN
  ARE THE APPLICATION'S DESIGN, CONTENT AND BEHAVIOR SIMILAR TO OTHER APPLICATIONS USED BY THE SAME AUDIENCE
  IS YOUR APPLCATION PART OF A FAMILY OR SUITE
  ARE THE PARTICULAR UI PATTERNS THAT YOUR USERS EXPECT BASED ON USING OTHER APPS


INTERNAL CONSISTNECY
  ESATBLISH PATTERNS FROM YOUR APP AND USE THEM CONSISTENTLY TO CREATE VISUAL LANGUAGE


HIERARCHY
* VISUAL HIERARCHY IS THE PERCEPTION AND INTERPRETATION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF OBJECTS
* CALL ATTENTION TO MOST IMPORTANT ARES TO GUIDE THE EYE

DEFINING DIFFERENCES
  - CONSISTENCY IS ABOUT MAKING THINGS LOOK AND BEHAVE THE SAME TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF USER FAMILIARTY AND EXPECTIATIONS
  - HIERARCHY IS ABOUT INDICATING DIFFERENCES THAT HELP PEOPLE


  LAYOUT
    - SCRREN SIZE
    - POSITION
    - WHITE SPACE AND MARGIN
    - PROXIMITY SCALE AND ALIGNMENT (TALKING ABOUT THE DISTANCE OF THE ELEMENTS, THINGS ARE RELATED SHOULD BE CLOSE TOGETHER )
    - GIRD
    - TEMPLATES



  COLOR
    PROVOKES EMOTIONAL RESPONSE

      HELPS PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT
        WHERE TO LOOK
        WHAT TO DO
      HELP AND APPLICATION STAND OUT
      COMMUNICATING WITH COLOR IS A BALANCING ACT THAT CAN BE BEST ACHEIVED WHEN CONTEXT OF USE, PHYSICAL USER CHARACTERISTICS AUDIENCE CULTURE ARE KNOWN

      COLOR CAN HELP ESTABLISH AND CONVEY HUERACHY
        WITH LAYOUT- HELP TELL USERS WHAT TO DO

TIME SCALE OF HUMAN ACTION
	- Descriptive model of the human
		- biological band (10^-4 <-> 10^-2 seconds) neuron, brain
		- cognitive band (10^-1 <-> 10 seconds) unit tasks, deliberate acts
		- rational band (10^2 <-> 10^4 seconds) task in general
		- social band (10^5 <-> 10^7 seconds )
	- Time is ordered by seconds and appears on a logarithm scale


** the most common dependent variable in experimental research in HCI is time


HUMAN FACTOR

HUMAN-----------------INTERFACE------------------COMPUTER
     |<----- Sensors <----|---- Displays <----|
     |			  |    		      |
BRAIN|			  |		      |MACHINE STATE
     |			  |		      |
     |-----> Responders --|---> Controls ---->|


	-> the human operator monitors the state of the computer through
           sensors and displays and controls the computer through responders
	   and controls

	->  the dashed vertical line is the interface where this takes place



SENSORS
	5 classical human sensors
		- sight ( information from the environment perceived by the eye)
		  -> frequency (perception of color )
		  -> intensity (amount of light / brightness)
		  -> Fixations and saccades (the duration of lookig at something)
		- hearing
		  -> loudness (sound pressure messured in decibel)
		  -> pitch (sharpness of the sound Hertz)
		  -> timbre (harmonic structure of sounds )
		- touch
		- taste
		- smell



COGNITION
	SENSORY STIMULUS -> COGNITIVE OPERATION -> MOTOR RESPONSE

the brain
	store retain and recall infomration
	useful for non-spontaneous decision
	short term working memory




mainifesations
	- reaction time
	  - delay between the occurances of a single fixed stimulus
	- visual search
	  - scans a collection of items searching for a desired item
	- skilled behavior
	  - a sensory stimulus imitates a simple cognitive oeration which is followed by a simple motor response
	- attention
	  - divided attention -> concentrating on doing more than one task at a time
	  - selected attention -> attending to one task to the exclusion of others
	- human error
	  - mishaps and miscues in human performace



11 October 2018

Personality
	- refers to impression formed based on appearance and behavior, a conecept that applies to applications as well as people
	- visceral design
		- appeareance
	- behavirial
		- pleasure and effectiveness of use
	- reflective design
		- self image personal satisfaction and memories

affordance
	- how to make unfamiliar situations affordable

constrains are powerful cues limiting the set of actions. Through the use of constrains in design, it readily allows

physical constrains -> rely on properties of the physical world
			- dials vs buttons vs silders
cultural constrains -> rely on socially learned behaviors
			- websites that uses cutural guiding thier user
semantic constrains -> rely on intrisic meaning
			- objects that shows implicit meaning
logical constrains -> rely on trial and reasoning

--- imposing these constrains prevents error and guide uses towards correct desired or useful behavior----


guiding interactions with constrains
	forcing fucntions
		e.g require logins to access content
	interlocks
		operations to take place in proper sequence
		e.g forms, forcing things to happen in a certain sequence
	lock in
		keeps an operation active, preventing someone from prematurely stopping it
		e.g Gmail checks if an attachment is attached before sending
	lock out
		keeps someone in a place or prevents an action until the desired operations have been done


feedback
	mention two reasons that make sound a challenging form of feedback
		e.g cant proceed without typing in a valid email address

Describe what is meant by internal and external consistency. Give an example of both kinds of
consistency in the context of a word processing application (4 points)
 	(1 point) internal consistency -> internal consistency would mean that the overall design in the word application itself would be the same
	(1 point) external consistency -> external consistency would mean that the overall designs would be similar with other word processing application
	(1 point) example 1 for internal consistency
	(1 point) example 2 for external consistency



Give examples of wo visual features that influence the perception of hierarchy (2 Points)
	- Size
	- Color


Kindle Paperwhite
you are tasked with building a better interface for the kindle Paperwhite
the device has only a power button, all interactions take place with using a touch screen

develop a basic scenario of dhow this interaction should unfold. What kind of constrains can you use
to make the usage of this device clear to a novice user.

what is a model
a model is a simplification of reality
  consider the architects model is a description that provides insight into space usage movement of people


Modelling interaction
     descriptive model
      - using loose verbal analogy an metaphor describe phenomena
     predictive model
     - model using closed form mathematical equations predict phenomena

Predictive modelling - Linear regression
  Basic prediction equation -> a linear relationship Y= mX + C
  an independent variable ( X )
  a dependent variable (Y)


Buxton three state model
 Descriptive model
    a vobaculary to recognize and explore the relationship between pointing device
     and the interaction techniques they afford

  1) out of range
  2) tracking
  3) dragging


state machine can be used to model interaction



Fitts law
  pointing is communication
  communication requires labels, identifiers
  the greater complexity of the identifier, the longer it takes

Exam question
provie a diagram for the model of human factors during interaction

describe the four bands of human action, giving an example for each
  - social band
  - biological band (10^-4 <-> 10^-2 seconds) neuron, brain
  - cognitive band (10^-1 <-> 10 seconds) unit tasks, deliberate acts
  - rational band (10^2 <-> 10^4 seconds) task in general

Virtual reality (VR)

3D computer generated display
inducing targeted behavior by using artificial sensory simulation with little or no awareness of the interference

VR induced motion sickness
	- Symptoms -> exposure to real and or apparent motion
	- real motion occurs <- experiencing unusual forces
	- Resulting in dizziness and nausea

vection
	- illusion of self motion that is caused by varying visual stimuli -> mismatched cues
	- Visually induced motion sickness
	- leads many people to experience sickness symptoms, such as dizziness, nausea and occasionally even vomiting


Handedness and interactions
  - people use hands differently
  - model of bimanual controls
  - describing the logic of division of labor
    - non preferred and preferred
Guiards model of bimanual control
	- non preferred hand
		- leads to preferred hand
		- sets the spatial frame of reference for the preferred hand
		- performs coarse movements

	- preferred hand
		- follows the preferred hand
		- works within established frame of reference set by the non-preferred hand
		- performs fine movements


Closed loop control
  - model of human factors during interaction -> Continuous control processing
  - an interactive system has to ascertain the intention of the user with the minimal effort on the part of the user




role of feedback
  - control requires feedback
  - a system without feedback is uncontrollable and unusable

  - the state that is fed back must offer opportunities for action



Touchscreen
  - continuous signal from an array of sensors
  - direct mapping relation of finger to display determines targeting
    - actually some tweaking goes on, but it is small

  - Control is over visual finger position relative to display

  - Position recovered from sensor "Image"



What are related to the group project / model view controller (MVC)

Model -> manages data, logic and rules
View -> represents information as output
Controller -> receives inputs and control model or view


                    |-------------|
                    |     MODEL   |
                    |-------------|
                    /             \
                   /               \
                  /                 \
                 /                   \
                /                     \
  |-------------|                      |-------------|
  |     VIEW    |<-------------------->| CONTROLLER  |
  |-------------|                      |-------------|

Advantages
  - backend and frontend can be changed independently (usually people working in frontend are not the same as backend, keep them separate to be happy )
  - Multiple views can be used with one model showing same data (a chart, a table, etc)
  - same vie can be reused with other models if they are programmed to an interface
  - easily change the behavior with another concerns

                    |-> input
          |->output |
          |         |

  Exam question -- There are no right or wrong answer, but we have to give a good example
  What are your assumptions?
    - You are designing a VR application to sell season tickets at a sports stadium. The application lets potential buyers see what their view would look like at different price Points
    - By yourself sketch up a quick persona and detail your assumption

Define physical constrains and give an example in the context of an ATM
- physically restricts which options are available

Given an example of affordance in the context of doors, describe how the design succeeds or fails at communicating affordance
- handles afford pulling
- car doors

Describe how constrains are used in interaction design to prevent errors. Provide a specific example, describing the kind of constrains used
- constrains guide users away from wrong inputs
- E.G Twitter field has a physical constrain as they only allowed 150 characters entry

Give an example of a constraint that forces desired behavior within an online interface, describing the kind of forcing function used
  - lock in -> keeps a operation active
  - save prompt in MS Word

Method / methodology
methodology is the way an experiment is designed and carried out

sound methodology is critical to allow us to understand what is really going on

Why does this matter
  - will help you run good studies that leads to good grades in your 3rd year group project and user study in 4th year dissertation
  - if you want to publish a scientific paper testing hypothesis you need to understand experimental design
  - Even if you don't end up running studies, you need to know how the data was collected in order to understand how to handle the data
  - its a good life skill - it gives us extra tools to think critically when you read the latest science story

Experimental design (Example)
  Best design for text input
    what are my experimental variables
      Independent variables - the circumstance that are not dependent to the user
        *  Also known as factors, experiments with independent variables that are often called factorial experiments
        *  these can be naturally occurring or directly manipulated by the experimenter
        *  Characteristics
            - e.g computer interface - feedback modality, the display size, display type
            - e.g participants - gender, handedness, expertise
        *  circumstances
          - background noise, room lighting

          Good practice to describe Independent Variables both in terms of name of the Characteristics / circumstances
          and the different levels of that Characteristics / circumstances

        *   Example of a Independent Variable : keyboard type


      Dependent variables(DV) - the circumstances that are dependent to the user
        * In HCI the dependent variable is normally measured human behavior. THe measurement depends on what the participant does
        * Any observable, measurable behavior

        Example of DV:  typing speed

      Control Variable - the circumstances that we are not investigating but they might influence participant behavior
        * Keyboard Angle
        * Chair Height

        * Experiments control these variables to prevent their influence by setting up their study in a controlled environment and recruiting with a strict inclusion

      Random Variable - the circumstances that we want to control but cannot control
        * Instead of attempting to control for everything , it is often better to allow some variables to vary randomly to generalize the results and because controlling everything is diffcult

      Confounding Variable - the circumstances that will change systematically with the independent variable
        * E.G Practice, different types of measurement for level of the IV
        * Such variables are Confounding because they prevent the possibility of a cause and effect relationship being inferred from the results. So they need to be controlled for. This is a central skill in experimental design

      Main effect -> when a Independent Variable leads a Dependent Variable
      Interaction effect -> when the Independent Variables are connected


      Levels and comparison
      increasing IV quickly accelerate your number of observed effects

            1 IV and 1 DV = 1 Main effects
            2 IV and 1 DV = 3 Main effects
            2 IV and 2 DV = 6 Main effects

      Task and procedure
        Represent
        have the task representative of what they actually do
          - external validity -> do differences generalize
          E.G Keyboard comparison. Have people type the kinds of things they would usually use a keyboard for

        Discriminate
        The task must be able to discriminate between two levels of the IV otherwise, in a way that allows the hypothesis to be tested
        Internal validity -> are differences due to the test conditions >
          E.g Keyboard comparison, dont make the task too easy as people  will have perfect performance no matter what

      Which smartphone text input method is the best
            - control : Phone type, standing , sitting
            - Random : Handedness age
            - confound : experience influencing learning between 1st and 2nd trial
          what can you do: select only experienced participants? Do training prior to task?
      Is white text on a black background  easier to read than black text on a white background
            - control : reading ability
            - Random : age, height
            - confound: how easy passages are to read / learning if  same passage for levels of IV
            what can you do : use passages of equivalent readability

      Participants
        recruitment methods
          - Ideal -> participants drawn at random from a population
              real population -> recruited sample
          - In practice -> convenience sampling
              real population -> convenient pop -> recruited sample

        How many partcipants should you recruit
          - more is better
            - however there is a balance btweeen representing the population and particial and sometimes ethical considerations
          - practical
            - not much time to recruit, population difficult to access, more testing delays product going to market
          - ethical
            - study puts particpants under some form of burden.
          - power analysis
            - if there is a srudy that used similar thecnique to you to investigate a similar phenomenon you could use those results to predict how many participants you would need to find the effects you expect
          - central limit theorem
              - as a sample size increases to above 30
          - ethics
              -

          - within or between subjects
            within
              - use both keyboards and measure the average difference in performace between the group
              Advantages
                - you control for any random differnces between people that may influence the results
                - fewer participants required
              Disadvantages
                - (need to find)

            between
              Advantages
                - compare beween your participants category are distinct compairing young and old (e.g)
                - avoid interference between testing
              - split the participants into two groups and one group use one keyboard


              which smartphone test input is the BEST
                - within
                  - experience with phones is controlled for (but not interaction between experience and learning during the ability)
                - between
                  - no learning effects but need to recruit 2x  partipants to




Experimental design (Example 2 )
  What are the factors that lead to a good grade
    Hypothesis 1: attending classes lead to a higher grade
    Hypothesis 2: reading leads to a higher grade

    |  Independent variable | Dependent Variable |
    |       attendance      |       Grade        |
    |       Reading         |       Grade        |

Order effects
  - Learning Effects
    - Order effects are usually a problem because of learning - People's performance on a tasks
  - Fatigue Effects


Dealing with order Effects
    - Pre training
        - get the participantued to doing the tasks before starting to collect data

    - Randomization
        - randomise the order of the conditions for each participant
          Appropriate when a task is very brief and if there are many repetioions or when there are many test conditions
    - Counterbalancing
        - Systematically order the test conditions to offset practice effects. For example, having half the participants use QWERT Keyboard first and use another board first.
          This gets more complex when there are more IVs and DV to consider


Advantages and Disadvantages of within and between

within
  ADVANTAGE
    -  no worries about human variability
    -  fewer participants needed
  Disadvantages
    - Experiment Duration (short tast )
