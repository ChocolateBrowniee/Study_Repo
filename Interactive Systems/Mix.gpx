    <name>GTFO! Festival 2018</name>
    <desc>Unleash the beast in you as the world's largest inflatable obstacle course The Beast sets up camp at the inaugural GTFO! Singapore at Palawan Green, Sentosa from December 7 to 9. The festival (also known as Get The Fun Out!) is a massive adult playground where you can break a sweat at fun and interesting fitness workshops, grab some tasty grub at the many food stalls and get your groove on with energetic beats courtesy of live DJs and bands.

The main draw is The Beast – a colossal 252-metre long fun zone that's made waves abroad at festivals such as Tomorrowland and Vidcon California, with stopovers in London, Paris, Amsterdam, LA and Melbourne, before finally making its Asian debut in Singapore. Amping up the fun-o-meter at the beach festival, the highly-raved travelling inflatable is twice as large as a football pitch with a plethora of obstacles for you to channel your inner Ninja Warrior. Think of it as a bouncy castle for kidults aged 18 and over where you get to crawl, bounce, slide, climb and run around this inflatable maze. But here's a little secret to beating The Beast: gear up in stretchy, comfortable clothes.

Up to slay The Beast? Secure tickets at GTFO! Singapore at $37 (standard 2-hours), $97 (VIP 1-day pass) and $197 (VIP 3-day pass). Entry to the festival ground is free and open to the public.

Time Out Singapore in partnership with GTFO!</desc>
